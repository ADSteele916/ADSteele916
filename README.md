### About Me

Hello! I’m Alex, a computer science and physics student at the University of British Columbia graduating in 2024. My interests include software development, data science, and academic research in both physics and computer science.

I am currently the lead teaching assistant for CPSC 110, UBC’s major-stream introductory computer science course, where I am responsible for many of our internal systems. I also work as a research assistant in computer science education, analyzing server data from past term's courses to find links between handin patterns and course performance. Lastly, in my free time, I contribute to the UBC Rocket design team as a member of the avionics subteam.

In the past, I have worked as a software engineer intern at Kepler Communications and both helped plan and volunteered at UBC's annual Physics Olympics competition.

I am actively searching for 4 or 8 month co-op opportunities beginning in May 2022.
