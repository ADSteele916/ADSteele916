### About Me

Hello! I'm Alex, a computer science and physics student at the University of British Columbia graduating in 2024. My interests include embedded and application development, machine learning, and numerical methods.

I'm currently a software engineer intern on the passive safety team at Tesla, and the lead teaching assistant for CPSC 110, UBC's major-stream introductory computer science course, where I am responsible for many of our internal systems. In my free time, I contribute to the UBC Rocket design team as a member of the avionics subteam and work on various [side projects](https://github.com/ADSteele916?tab=repositories). I also both help plan and volunteer at UBC's annual Physics Olympics competition.

In the past, I've worked as a software engineer intern at Kepler Communications and a numerical methods research assistant in UBC's Numerical Linear Algebra Lab. 

I'm not currently looking for co-op opportunities, but I am starting to look for new grad roles beginning in May 2024.
