### Hello!

Hello! I’m Alex, a computer science and physics student at the University of British Columbia graduating in 2024. My fields of interest include software development, data science, and physics research.

I am currently a software engineering intern at Kepler Communications; a lead teaching assistant for CPSC 110, UBC’s major-stream introductory computer science course, where I am responsible for many of our internal systems; and a member of the avionics subteam of the UBC Rocket design team.
