### About Me

Hello! I'm Alex, a computer science and physics student at the University of British Columbia graduating in 2024. My interests include software development, data science, and academic research in both physics and computer science.

I'm currently the lead teaching assistant for CPSC 110, UBC's major-stream introductory computer science course, where I am responsible for many of our internal systems. In my free time, I contribute to the UBC Rocket design team as a member of the avionics subteam and work on various [side projects](https://github.com/ADSteele916?tab=repositories).

In the past, I've worked as a software engineer intern at Kepler Communications and both helped plan and volunteered at UBC's annual Physics Olympics competition.

I'm actively searching for 4 month co-op opportunities beginning in September 2022.
